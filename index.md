**Effects of the Economy on the Incumbent President's Chances**

September 19th, 2020

Question: Is the effect of the economy stronger for sitting presidents running for re-election compared to same-party heirs seeking the office? Does the predictive power of economy change across time? If so, why?

Prediction: 

We examine the relationship between the national popular vote in presidential elections for an incumbent President versus an incumbent party candidate and two economic factors: real disposable income and unemployment. Each of these factors impacts different groups of people in different ways. We note that many people will always vote Democrat or Republican based on their views on issues such as healthcare, abortion, religion, and more. These people comprise the majority of voters in very liberal states like California and Massachusetts or very conservative states like West Virginia or Oklahoma. However, for undecided voters, the predominant question is which candidate is more likely to improve their lives the most. Especially as COVID 19 has led many people to lose their jobs, many voters will be looking to choose the candidate whom they believe will get them back on their feet and save them from getting evicted.

We begin by looking at RDI_Growth, specifically the second quarter, as this is fresh in voters' minds when they cast their ballots in November.

We get is a correlation between RDI_growth in the second quarter and the popular vote of the incumbent candidate of approximately 0.75. The best fit line above is given by the equation y = 500.68x + 48.33. Since the second quarter RDI growth of 2020 was 0.097%, this model would predict that Donald Trump would win 500.68(0.09724) + 48.33 = 97.01% of the vote! Obviously, this is absurd and no electoral predictions for this election are remotely close to this. The issue here is that the RDI_growth in the second quarter of 2020 was fairly high at 0.097% as the government passed the PPP and stimulus checks in order to help businesses continue to pay their workers as they shut down due to COVID 19.

Question: Which states are/have been swing states? Which are no longer swing states?

Prediction: In the 2020 election, based solely on trends in the popular vote within each state, the swing states will likely include Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, and Texas.

These states are expected to be close in the 2020 election, and whoever wins the majority of them will almost certainly be the next President of the United States. Here, we look at how the swing states have changed over time. To do this, we only consider the two party vote for each state, and we compute the difference between the Democratic proportion of the two party vote in year y and in year y-4. A positive number with large magnitude indicates a Democratic shift, while a a negative number with large magnitude indicates a Republican shift. While we typically think of swing states as having extremely close elections, under this model we are actually looking for larger differences between two consecutive presidential elections in order to see which states swing significantly from one election to the next.

We see a large blue wave from 2004 to 2008 across the country:

Then, from 2008 to 2012, things mostly stayed the same, with some light red shifts throughout the country:

Finally, from 2012 to 2016, we see the midwest shift red while some southern states shift blue:

We see that Utah is the darkest red state from 2008 to 2012 and the darkest blue state from 2012 to 2016. However, this is likely due to Mitt Romney's popularity in his home state and is not indicative of Utah swinging broadly from one election to the next in general.

There are a number of interesting trends that we can note from these swing maps. For example, we see that from 2008 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2016 that Missouri has gotten progressively redder. In 2008, John McCain narrowly beat Barack Obama in Missouri with a slim margin of 0.135% of the two party vote. A former swing state, Missouri now appears to be safely in Republican hands.
 
We can also see that several reliably blue states are trending towards being much more swingy. For example, Democrats have won Minnesota in every election since 1976, including in 1984 when Ronald Reagan won every other state (although it is worth noting that his opponent Walter Mondale was from Minnesota, which enabled him to escape with a 0.182% majority of the two party vote). However, we see that from 2008 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2016, Minnesota has swerved much closer to the center.
 
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin show similar trends. After voting blue in every election since 1992 (and 1988 in the case of Wisconsin), these three states flipped in 2016. If we look at the maps, we see that all three states have been getting redder since 2008.
 
On the other hand, some reliably red states are also moving towards the center, including Arizona, Georgia, and Texas. Since the end of George W Bushâ€™s second term, Texas has been moving closer to the center, most notably from 2004 to 2008 and 2012 to 2016. Georgia follows a similar pattern. From 2008 to 2012 they each leaned slightly Republican compared to the previous election, but the trend is towards the center. Arizona has also been shifting blue in more recent elections.
 
From these trends, it appears that the midwest is turning red, while the south is getting more blue. As these regions approach the center from opposite directions, it is likely that these are the states which will decide the outcome of the elections in 2020 and the near future.
