Question: Which states are/have been swing states? Which are no longer swing states?

Prediction: In the 2020 election, based solely on trends in the popular vote within each state, the swing states will likely include Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, and Texas.

These states are expected to be close in the 2020 election, and whoever wins the majority of them will almost certainly be the next President of the United States. Here, we look at how the swing states have changed over time. To do this, we only consider the two party vote for each state, and we compute the difference between the Democratic proportion of the two party vote in year y and in year y-4. While we typically think of swing states as having extremely close elections, under this model we are actually looking for larger differences between two consecutive presidential elections in order to see which states swing significantly from one election to the next.

We see a large blue wave from 2004 to 2008 across the country:

Then, from 2008 to 2012, things mostly stayed the same, with some states going slightly red:

Finally, from 2012 to 2016, we see:

There are a number of interesting trends that we can note from these swing maps. For example, we see that from 2008 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2016 that Missouri has gotten progressively redder. In 2008, John McCain narrowly beat Barack Obama in Missouri with a slim margin of 0.135% of the two party vote. A former swing state, Missouri now appears to be safely in Republican hands.
 
We can also see that several reliably blue states are trending towards being much more swingy. For example, Democrats have won Minnesota in every election since 1976, including in 1984 when Ronald Reagan won every other state (although it is worth noting that his opponent Walter Mondale was from Minnesota, which enabled him to escape with a 0.182% majority of the two party vote). However, we see that from 2008 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2016, Minnesota has swerved much closer to the center.
 
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin show similar trends. After voting blue in every election since 1992 (and 1988 in the case of Wisconsin), these three states flipped in 2016. If we look at the maps, we see that all three states have been getting redder since 2008.
 
On the other hand, some reliably red states are also moving towards the center. For the 2020 election, two of the most watched traditionally Republican states are Texas and Georgia. Since the end of George W Bushâ€™s second term, Texas has been moving closer to the center, most notably from 2004 to 2008 and 2012 to 2016. Georgia follows a similar pattern. From 2008 to 2012 they each leaned slightly Republican compared to the previous election, but the trend is towards the center.
 
From these trends, it appears that the midwest is turning red, while the south is getting more blue. As these regions approach the center from opposite directions, it is likely that these are the states which will decide the outcome of the elections in 2020 and the near future.
